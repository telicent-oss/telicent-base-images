However, when building container images using this source code, the resulting container image itself is subject to the
**Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) 9 End User License Agreement (EULA)**.

### Important Licensing Considerations for RHEL Users:
If this project is built on a licensed Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host, the build process may enable full RHEL repositories.
This can result in the installation of packages covered by the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Subscription Agreement.
Those packages may not be legally run on non-RHEL systems without a valid RHEL subscription.
